# Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts stock prices using machine learning models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, KNN, and SVM. An ensemble model (Voting Regressor) is used to combine the predictions of these models to improve accuracy. Additionally, sentiment analysis is performed using news data to capture the impact of significant news events on stock prices.

## Features
- Uses real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance.
- Predicts future stock prices based on historical data and news sentiment.
- Combines multiple regression models for enhanced accuracy.
- Incorporates sentiment analysis to capture market sentiment impact.
- Evaluates performance with metrics like MSE, MAE, and RÂ².
